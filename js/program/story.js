The ${words[0]}

On a cool autumn afternoon, a blustery wind was making leaves ${words[1]} along the path as young ${words[2]} walked home from school. Just as the bubbling ${words[3]} Creek came into sight, a strangely-shaped object caught ${words[2]}'s eye. From a distance, it looked at first to be a bent ${words[4]} or perhaps even a broken ${words[5]}. 

Although Mother said it was important to come straight home from school in order to get chores done before dinner, ${words[2]} stepped off the path and walked steadily toward the object, an insatiable curiosity taking over. Surely this was more interesting than washing ${words[6]} loads of laundry and ${words[7]} the dishes! 

Upon reaching the mysterious object, ${words[2]} was flummoxed. What could it possibly be? Was it some kind of ${words[8]}? It was also possible that it was a long-lost part from a vintage ${words[9]}! ${words[2]} decided to take it home. But UGH! It was covered in ${words[10]}. Gross.

${words[2]} carried it quickly over to the creek and washed the disgusting goo from the strange item. It seemed much brighter now, shiny like a ${words[11]} and the color of a ${words[12]}. ${words[2]} scrambled across the dry, ${words[13]} leaves and skipped down the path toward home.

Clambering noisily through the back door as children often do, ${words[2]} yelled, "Moooommmmm! Come see what I found!" 

${words[2]}'s older sister came around the corner and yelled, "Where on ${words[14]} have you been? And what in the name of ${words[15]} is that thing?!?" Her face was all twisted up with an unmistakable expression of ${words[16]}.

"I don't know." said ${words[2]}, plunking the object down and grabbing ${words[17]} ${words[18]}. "I'm going to ask Mom. Where is she, anyway?"

"Here I am!" ${words[2]}'s mother came into the room and let out a burst of laughter as soon as she saw what was on the kitchen counter. "Oh, my child - you bring home the ${words[19]} things! Where did you find that rotary telephone, anyway?"

THE END
